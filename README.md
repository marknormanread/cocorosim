# cocorosim

Underwater swarm robotics simulation, developed as part of the CoCoRo project. 

This code was originally hosted on a University of Graz (the coordinating partners of the CoCoRo project, under which this simulation was built) website. 
That website has since gone down, for reasons unknown to me. 
Hence, I am hosting it here instead. 

Contained herein are several versions of the simulation that have been used for papers [1, 2] generated by the University of York. 
I've included the original code base also. 

Please see the 'CoCoRoSim_documentation.doc' file for documentation on how to use CoCoRoSim. 
You are welcome to ask questions of me about this, but please understand it has been 8 years (at time of writing) since I was involved in this project - my ability to provide support is very limited.
